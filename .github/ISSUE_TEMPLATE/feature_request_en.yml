        ## 💡 Feature Request
        Thank you for taking the time to suggest a new feature!
        This project is **Foundation Sunshine**, a self-hosted game stream host for Moonlight.
        
        **⚠️ Important: This template is only for submitting Sunshine server-side feature requests. Client-side (Moonlight) issues should not be submitted here.**

        **Please check before submitting:**
        - [ ] I have searched existing issues and feature requests to avoid duplicates
        - [ ] This feature is not already available in the latest version
        - [ ] This feature is specific to the server-side (Sunshine), not the client-side (Moonlight)
        - [ ] I am using Windows 10/Windows 11 (Virtual Display feature requires Windows 10 22H2 or higher)
